# PDOS (aka Pixel Developers Operating System)
I made a basic operating system in c/c++ and asm.
I wil update the source code every week.
I am going to work on the operating system until I it has a good gui, ...
Every time when I change something big the progress will be updated.
PROGRESS:
1) MAKE A BOOTLOADER, LINKER, KERNEL: DONE!
2) MAKE A PRINTF FUNCTION: DONE!, IMPORT KEYBOARD: DONE!, READ USERINPUT DONE!



TO BUILD THE OS JUST RUN THE BUILD.SH SCRIPT IN THE TERMINAL WITH: sudo ./build.sh
TO RUN THE OS JUST TYPE IN THE TERMINAL: qemu-system-i386 -kernel PDOS.bin or qemu-system-i386 -kernel PDOS.img
